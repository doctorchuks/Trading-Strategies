STRATEGY ALGORITHM

Are we in a range or a trend?
	|Trend:  Does the trend have more than 2 legs already?
	|	|Yes: Can the trend be enclosed in trend and trend channel lines?
 	|	|	Can be enclosed: Enclose and use the confirmation method, only when price reaches one of the trend or trend channel line.
	|	|
	|	|	Can't be enclosed:Mark the immediate past swing high/low and use the confirmation method only when price reaches the marked level.
	|	|
	|	|No: Wait for a second leg, so we can confirm the trend and aim to catch the third leg.
	|Range: Does the range have two taps on each side already?
	|	|Yes: Use the confirmation method only when price reaches one of the range extremes.
	|	|
	|	|No: Wait for the range to develop two taps on each side or look to trade a LTF trend.
