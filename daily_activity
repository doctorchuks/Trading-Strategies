TECHNICAL
Procedure
   4H
	Starting from the 4H chart, where price is currently and the nearest areas of value around it
	Draw new levels or trendlines if there are any that are better formed
	Remove levels that are no longer in play or reduce their opacity if they could still be relevant
  1H	
	Go down to the 1H chart and redo the above steps
	Look for any levels that have confluence to their role as magnets.
	Note fib 50%, volume profile nodes, round numbers, past levels with mad wick rejections
   PATHS
	Still on the 1H chart, using the path tool, draw any possible paths that price might follow, each path should be followed with a note on what you'd do when price follows that path
   NOTES	
	Write down a general note beside the weekly note in the ffg pattern:
		1H Trend:
		Expectations(1H):
		Expectations(15m):
   ALERTS: Bidirectional alerts
	Set price alerts around levels you would enter a trade, also set alerts in the opposite direction so I can know if the market does something unexpected


FUNDAMENTAL
   ALARMS 
	Set alarms 30 and 15 mins before all the high priority events (3-star events in tradingeconomics.com)
