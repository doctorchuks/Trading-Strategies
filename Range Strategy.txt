types of ranges 

regular consolidations
higher time frame consolidations
converging consolidations
diverging consolidations
one sided consolidations
Weak breakouts of ranges


Trading Horizontally Bound Consolidations
When i see a HB Consolidation, I enclose the range in a rectangle with its upper and lower boundaries at the range edge.
The boundaries would be the outermost levels within the range that were tested the most, any outliers can be viewed as breakouts.
I select the midpoint of the range as that is the most respected level within an HB Range

To trade 
Conditions
I do not enter trades, not even late entries when price has gone far from the range extreme, deeper into the range as this would affect Reward:Risk
I dont view ranges with the perspective of always looking for a breakout, I trade what I see 


Entries
I set price alerts at the range extremes and when price gets there I only enter on sign of weakness and reversal(define later)



Stops
I set my stops few ticks above the highest breakout(for a short), or lowest breakout(for a long) as a move beyond these prices breaks market structure
