this is my daily ta document
to avoid me writing and cancelling in my strategy journal document

Daily TA 

GOAL
The goal of daily ta is to help me identify the markets behavior, place what has happened into perspective, tell where the market is from there, place the previous days
move into the already made picture and also to structure my actions, defining what i would wait for and what i would do if the market went either way

PROCEDURE


TIMEFRAMES AND ROLES 
1D - To get historical levels, these would still be refined on the 1H chart to fit more recent data. Refreshed weekly
4H - to get the major trend - character of the past 3 life weeks on the 4H chart: to be refreshed every weekend as the week prints 30 new 4h bars
			      any major trendlines should be drawn on the 4H 
			      levels should not be drawn as youd be drawing levels that would be too wide and still need refinement on lower tf
1H - to get the minor trend - character of the past 3 trading days(72 HOURLY BARS) on the 1H chart
			      key levels, smaller trend lines, support and resistance
			      chart patterns
			      all levels drawn are to be labelled on the right hand top of what they represent
			      old levels no longer in play are to be made more transparent ad delabelled to be deleted weekends
15M - to get smaller patterns, candlesticks, 
			     we draw obvious value areas here: gaps, vol profile gaps, round nos, fib r levels, levels with multiple wick rejections, 
			     we also write a short note describing the market structure so far 
			     we deduce local bullish strength by 
				- length of bull impulses
				- freq of bull trend bars 
				- respect of bullish support structures
			     we deduce local bearish strength by 
				- length of bear impulses
				- freq of bear trend bars 
				- respect of bearish resistance structures
if the move in any side is a direct response to moving news, but doesnt line up with the minor trend, thats a fake move
if the trend is supported by direct reactions to news, we trade the trend till it climaxes

either way, our always in direction is the minor trend
